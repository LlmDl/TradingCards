Paper plugin for Trading Cards.
A modified version of Trading Cards for the TreasureIsland minecraft network.
Currently, has only some improvements over the original plugin:
*  Cached Cards (On load).
*  Sell Command.
*  Active Series.
*  Debug commands - Version, Modules, Rarities.

## Patches:
*  Proper use of VaultAPI.
*  Tab Completions for commands.

## Addons:
This version of Trading Cards doesn't support MythicMobs, MobArena & Towny out of the box. 
For support, you need to install additional addons:
*  [TCTowny](https://github.com/TreasureIslandMC/TCTowny)
*  [TCMythicMobs](https://github.com/TreasureIslandMC/TCMythicMobs)
*  [TCMobArena](https://github.com/TreasureIslandMC/TCMobArena)

These are normal plugins, to install just place in your plugins folder.
