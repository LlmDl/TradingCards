# Chance chance/rarity based on the level of the mob?

# With this you're able to set the individual rarity chances of every mythic mob level.
# For example, you could make it so level 100 boss-type mobs always drop shiny legendaries.
# You can add as many levels as you want, if a mob is higher than the highest level here,
# its chances will be based on the highest level in this config. E.G. if you only have
# levels 0-5 here and you kill a level 10 mob, it will use the level 5 chances.
