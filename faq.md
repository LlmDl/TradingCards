# ‚ùì FAQ



1. **I want to disable card drops:** See [Chances](https://github.com/sarhatabaot/TradingCards/blob/master/tradingcards-plugin/src/main/resources/settings/chances.yml). Omitting the type will prevent the cards from being dropped.
2. **I'm using ItemsAdder or a custom resource pack and my commands are getting replaced with emojis!** See [#182](https://github.com/sarhatabaot/TradingCards/issues/182) for a fix!
3. **Does TradingCards have a pre-made custom resource pack?** We currently don't have one. However isaaclepes from the community has made one! You can find it here [https://github.com/isaaclepes/TradingCardsResource](https://github.com/isaaclepes/TradingCardsResource), it currently required optifine to work.
4. **I want to add a custom texture to my cards!** We support using custom-model-data, use the `/cards edit <cardId> CUSTOM_MODEL_DATA <data>` to edit the data.
