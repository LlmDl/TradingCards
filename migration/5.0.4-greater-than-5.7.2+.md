# 5.0.4 -> 5.7.2+

It is recommended that you backup your content and start from the beginning.. Starting from version 5.4 there are a lot of changes made. (You can still use your old cards.yml)

#### Migrating

If you still want to move everything over, follow these steps:

1. Backup your XensTradingCards folder.
2. Install TradingCards.
3. Restart your server.
4. Compare your cards.yml with the new cards.yml using vscode, and apply any changes you need.
5. Add your rarities to rarities.yml
6. Add your series to series.yml
7. Modify chances.yml with your own values
8. Compare your messages.yml with the new messages.yml, there a lot of new messages so keep that in mind.
9. That's it!
10. If you want to move to SQL use the guide from [5.6.x-yaml-greater-than-sql.md](5.6.x-yaml-greater-than-sql.md "mention")
